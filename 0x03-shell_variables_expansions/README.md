# Shell Scripting Project

This project consists of several shell scripts that perform various tasks. Below is a brief description of each script:

## Task 0: Create an Alias (0-alias)

This script creates an alias named `ls` that maps to the command `rm *`. When the alias is activated, it will remove all files in the current directory when you use the `ls` command.

## Task 1: Hello You (1-hello_you)

This script prints "hello user" where "user" is the current Linux user.

## Task 2: Add to PATH (2-path)

This script adds `/action` to the end of the system's PATH environment variable. This ensures that `/action` is the last directory the shell looks into when searching for a program.

## Task 3: Count Directories in PATH (3-paths)

This script counts the number of directories in the PATH environment variable and displays the count.

## Task 4: List Environment Variables (4-global_variables)

This script lists all the environment variables available on the system.

## Task 5: List Local and Environment Variables (5-local_variables)

This script lists both local and environment variables, as well as functions.

## Task 6: Create a Local Variable (6-create_local_variable)

This script creates a new local variable named `BEST` with the value "School."

## Task 7: Create a Global Variable (7-create_global_variable)

This script creates a new global variable named `BEST` with the value "School."

## Task 8: Addition of Environment Variables (8-true_knowledge)

This script calculates the result of adding 128 to the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` and displays the result.

## Task 9: Division of Environment Variables (9-divide_and_rule)

This script calculates the result of dividing the value stored in the environment variable `POWER` by the value stored in `DIVIDE` and displays the result.

## Task 10: Exponentiation of Environment Variables (10-love_exponent_breath)

This script calculates the result of raising the value of `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE` and displays the result.

## Task 11: Binary to Decimal Conversion (11-binary_to_decimal)

This script converts a binary number stored in the environment variable `BINARY` to its decimal representation and displays the result.

## Task 12: Combinations of Letters (12-combinations)

This script generates all possible combinations of two lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' (except "oo") and prints them, one combination per line.

## Task 13: Printing a Float (13-print_float)

This script formats and prints a number stored in the environment variable `NUM` with two decimal places.

## Task 14: Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion (100-decimal_to_hexadecimal)

This script converts a decimal number stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL` to its hexadecimal representation and displays the result.

## Task 15: Rot13 Encryption/Decryption (101-rot13)

This script performs ROT13 encryption and decryption on text data provided via standard input.

## Task 16: Printing Every Other Line (102-odd)

This script prints every other line from the input starting with the first line. It is designed to be used in a pipeline.

## Task 17: Addition in Custom Bases (103-water_and_stir)

This script adds two numbers stored in the environment variables `WATER` and `STIR`, which are in custom bases (water and stir). It then prints the result in another custom base (bestchol).
